Papanasul that killed JFK ! Once upon a time there was a papanash
He had a cherry topping from Brasil. He was very furious about the state of the economy in America.
He decided to finally take action and go against the state.
His main enemy nr 1 is John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the USA.
Guide him in his mission to take him out! 

Was afraid of Piedone ( :o ). He was once a member of the Romanian Communist Party

Our Papanas takes a passenger ship in the port of Constanta. On his way, the ship stops in Istanbul.
He dreamt of eating a local kebab but he doesnt have the turkish lira.

He teleports right into the Oval Office, but instead of JFK, he lands on a confused cat sitting on the president's desk.
The cat looks at him and meows, "You got the wrong address, buddy!" 
Papanasul, now, in a very special situation, has to decide if he should:
    5 -> Starts fighting the cat
    6 -> Apologize to the cat and ask for directions
    7 -> Papanasul unlocks his inner magic powers
