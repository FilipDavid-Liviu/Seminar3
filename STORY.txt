Papanasul, fueled by adrenaline, lunges at the cat, but the feline swiftly dodges, leaving him to crash into the desk. 
The cat, now amused, flicks its tail and says, "Is that all you've got? I've faced tougher mice!" 
Realizing he needs a new strategy, Papanasul decides to charm the cat with a dance, hoping to win its favor instead of a fight.

    502 -> Papanasul offers the cat a piece of his kebab in hopes of winning its trust.
