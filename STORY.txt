Papanasul that killed JFK ! Once upon a time there was a papanash
He had a cherry topping from Brasil. He was very furious about the state of the economy in America.
He decided to finally take action and go against the state.
His main enemy nr 1 is John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the USA.
Guide him in his mission to take him out! 

Was afraid of Piedone ( :o ). He was once a member of the Romanian Communist Party

1 
He starts his day off in the fryer (air-fryer cause he is poor) in Romania. A humble young boy. 
He travels to New York.
    2 -> He travels by plane
    3 -> He travels by Sea
    4 -> He teleports

Airport security time! 
What does Papanash have in his suitcase (vry professional)
    200 -> machine gun >:), 
    201 -> another papanash
    202 -> nothind
    203 -> passport

Our Papanas takes a passenger ship in the port of Constanta. On his way, the ship stops in Istanbul.
He dreamt of eating a local kebab but he doesnt have the turkish lira. 
He decides to:
    301 -> Steal from a man 
    302 -> Steal from a woman
    
301
He sees an old hungry man in the shipyard standing on a bench. He goes to him and introduces himself.
The old man is stunned when he hears him talk, but this doesn't stop him from trying to grab him so he can 
eat him. This papanas is no ordinary papanas, he is skilled in the arts of fighting.
    303 -> he rolls through his sleve and knoks him down with an uppercut
    304 -> he pulls out a gun and shoots the man
    305 -> he talks the man out of the idea
303
Papanas surprises the old man with his bold move and knoks him down in one hit, gets his wallet but surprisee,
no money in there. Afraid of not being caught the papanas goes back to his cruise hungry and dissapointed (see 320)
304 
When the old man sees the pistol comming his way he disrupts the simulation and doges the bullets. Before our papanas can bat an eye 
he is grabed and eaten by this old hungry man.
305 
He stops the man right before he can eat him and he tels him about his family and the beautifull papanas children, about his dream of 
going to the USA, and about EATING KEBAB. the old man is moved by the kebab story so he choses to help the papanas so they go togheter to the bank
to extract money.
    306 -> steal his credit card and run
    307 -> be peacefull
306
when we get to the bank the papanas takes a peak and memorises the old mans credit card pin. Right after the old man got his money
the papanas attacks with an uppercut but its to slow and the old man grabs him and eats him, dissapointed in his betrail.
307
They happily go and eat the kebab!

He teleports right into the Oval Office, but instead of JFK, he lands on a confused cat sitting on the president's desk.
The cat looks at him and meows, "You got the wrong address, buddy!" 
Papanasul, now, in a very special situation, has to decide if he should:
    5 -> Starts fighting the cat
    6 -> Apologize to the cat and ask for directions
    7 -> Papanasul unlocks his inner magic powers
